<p>Robot Framework provides native solution how to wait for element to be visible and vice versa. But using such keywords as
    <code>Wait Until Element Is Not Visible</code> or <code>Wait Until Element Is Visible</code> with timeout often fails with Stale Element Exception.
    And I try not to use these keywords in my test scripts to avoid possible undesirable flakiness.
</p>

<p>Often enough I have to know when loader element has already disappeared and I can continue to perform further actions and checks.
    In such cases I use a kind of 'Wait Until Element Is Not Visible workaround'. </p>

<p>
    <code>
        <pre>
        *** Keyword ***
        Wait For Loader To Disappear
        :FOR    ${i}    IN RANGE    15
        \    Sleep  1
        \    ${present}=  Run Keyword And Return Status    Element Should Be Visible    ${loaderId}
        \    Exit For Loop If    ${present}==False
        \    log  Wait for loader to disappear ${i} sec     console=True
        </pre>
    </code>
</p>

<p>This keyword can be modified a little bit to accept '15' or any other value - seconds to wait - as a parameter:</p>

<p>
    <code>
        <pre>
        *** Keyword ***
        Wait For Loader To Disappear
        [Arguments]    ${seconds}
        :FOR    ${i}    IN RANGE    ${seconds}
        \    Sleep  1
        \    ${present}=  Run Keyword And Return Status    Element Should Be Visible    ${loaderId}
        \    Exit For Loop If    ${present}==False
        \    log  Wait for loader to disappear ${i} sec     console=True
        </pre>
    </code>
